# my-dev-website

This is my own blogging website for JavaScript developers. This website is using my own [REST API](https://github.com/AlexErdei73/blog-api). This is a React app to browse the bloggs of the users and view them. There is another front-end app to edit the bloggs, which is linked to this app.
